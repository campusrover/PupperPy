**Behavior Trees (in progress)**

**Instructions**

Complex behavior for the CERBaris is a behavior tree implementation dependent on the py_trees library.

~~~bash
sudo pip install py-trees
~~~

To run the current behavior iteration, simply run control_loop_tree.py from the pupperpy directory after successfully connecting to the robot via SSH.
~~~bash
cd /your/path/to/PupperPy/pupperpy
sudo pigpiod
sudo python3 control_loop.py
~~~

Behavior trees are a way to compartmentalize code segments into manipulable nodes. They were chosen over finite state machines and decision trees due to their comparative power, improved modularity, as well as ease of interpretation.

(The above diagram illustrates the default pupper behavior at a high level, with "meandering" being the current running action. In terms of composite node logic, this implies that avoiding obstacles has finished, and that turning around did not lead to finding the ball.)

**More Notes**

The control loop overrides the Control object from CommandInterface. All action leaves are subscribed to the incoming data stream from CommandInterface, and the running node sends commands to it to publish.

Actions and conditions are housed in the Behavior folder. To create a new action, create a new class extending a pytrees behavior and define new setup and init functions.

The structure of the behavior tree can be expressed as an indented file, which is parsed and read by the CERBaris web service, and in turn returned, read, and restructured as a new behavior tree.

Every node in the behavior tree is labelled as running, succeeded, or failed, depending on whether its conditions for completion are met. The code assigns ids to each node in the tree and keeps track of the current running node at all times.
