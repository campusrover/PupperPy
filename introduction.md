title: Introduction

As a team we set out to build the [Standford Pupper
robot](https://stanfordstudentrobotics.org/pupper) and see how far we could
extend the software, hardware and overall functionality of the system over the
course of a semester.

We initally set out to create a robot that could freely move around an enviroment autonomously and seek out visual targets without colliding with any objects.
To this end our team added sensors, implement computer
vision and created a software package for controlling the pupper robot
programatically while reading out live operation information onto a webpage.
